# Lesson 8

In this lesson we explored interfaces, classes, access modifiers

- `models` directory: Contains TypeScript files demonstrating interfaces 
- `abstractions` directory: Contains TypeScript files demonstrating abstract classes and inheritance
- `breeds.ts`: Shows different animal breeds and their characteristics.
- `index.ts`: Main entry point that creates instances of classes and demonstrates their usage.

## Getting Started

To install the necessary dependencies, run:

```
npm i
```

To run the examples, you can use Node.js. For instance, to run `index.ts`, use the command:

```
npx ts-node index.ts
```
