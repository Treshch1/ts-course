# Lesson 9

In this lesson we explored OOP and SOLID principles in TypeScript. The code examples demonstrate the use of interfaces, abstract classes, and inheritance.

- `vehicles.ts` file: Contains classes for different types of vehicles (Car, ElectricScooter) that extend an abstract Vehicle class. 
- `index.ts` interacts with these classes to show their functionality.

## Getting Started

To install the necessary dependencies, run:

```
npm i
```

To run the examples, you can use Node.js. For instance, to run `index.ts`, use the command:

```
npx ts-node src/index.ts
```
