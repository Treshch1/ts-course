# Lesson 10 Mocha

In this lesson we explored Mocha test runner with Chai assertions in TypeScript. The code examples demonstrate how to set up and run tests for the vehicle classes created in the previous lesson.

- `test` directory: Contains test files that use Mocha and Chai to test the functionality of the vehicle classes.

## Getting Started

To install the necessary dependencies, run:

```
npm i
```

To run the tests, you can use Node.js.

```
npm run test
```
