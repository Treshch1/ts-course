# Lesson 13

In this lesson we explored integration and contract testing using tools like Pact. Integration tests help ensure that different parts of our application work together as expected, while contract tests verify that services communicate correctly based on predefined agreements.

## Getting Started

To install the necessary dependencies, run:

```
npm i
```

To run the tests, you can use Node.js.

```
npm run test
```
